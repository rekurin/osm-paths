# osm-paths
A python script that maps out all paths to cover all intersections in a node graph graph generated by OSM.
Algorithm: 
1. Convert path into an edge list between nodes with distances calculated by each nodes coodinate points.
2. Run Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to generate shortest path. 
3. Double the length each edge on the shortest path
4. Repeat until all edges are visisted.
